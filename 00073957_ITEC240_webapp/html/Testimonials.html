"By far one of the best Trinidadian music Producers out there!"
If you are looking for the best recording experience, this is the place to record your music. KMJ is such a great guy and made me at ease whilst working. This helped me create my best work, which  would have been difficult for someone like me with limited knowledge of theory and technicalities. KMJ interpreted my ideas even with limited guidelines. He is a outstanding producer and has by far one of the best Trinidad studios out there!”

"Always interprets what I am thinking musically, then colours it in and brings it to life!"
“I have been to many studios with music producers and thought everything was ok until I discovered KMJ Recording Studio in 2019. It has been a truly rewarding experience and better than ever. With me being a songwriter and non-musician, I have always needed someone who can interpret what I am thinking. KMJRS has done this and more. My first record, Life In The Caribbean has been released and getting air-play internationally, and am I happy – you bet ya. KMJ is a excellent producer and Top Rated.”

KMJRS, I appreciate every moment spent making music with you at your studio. Your love of music, your creative skills and how you conduct business has been above my expectations. You're better than any other producer I've dealt with in my past (no exaggeration). The music you create is remarkable and awe-inspiring. I always look forward to our next session because each time it gets better. Thank you much!!!
